The sacrifice ratio may be higher or lower in the active fiscal policy regime depending on the fiscal rule and the design of the disinflation policy. Fiscal-led disinflations may be less costly than monetary-led ones when they are anticipated. However, they may generate larger sacrifice ratios than monetary-led ones when implemented “cold turkey”. Overall, the variance in possible sacrifice ratios under fiscal-led policies is much higher than under monetary-led policies."}],"languages":[{"language":"Chinese","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"Japanese","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}]}
